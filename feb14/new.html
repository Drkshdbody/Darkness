          <span>Dear Idk,</span>
          <br />
          I don't say it often, but I hope you know,
          How much you mean, how much you show.
          Through every high and every low,
          You stay beside me, help me grow.
          <br /><br />
          You comfort me in ways so true,
          With words so soft, with all you do.
          Yet when I slip, you call me out,
          With care, not spiteâ€”just love, no doubt.
          <br /><br />
          I may be stubborn, lost at times,
          Yet still, you stand, your hand in mine.
          No grandest gift could match what's trueâ€”
          I'm just so grateful, grateful for you.
          <br /><br />
          <span class="ullu">
            Forever Your friend
            <br />
